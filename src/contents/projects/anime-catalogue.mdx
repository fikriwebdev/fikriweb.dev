## Introduction

In this project i created a website to show anime listing. The information i gave to user is about anime ranking, upcoming anime, specific anime detail. You can visit the website [AnimeCatalogue](https://animecatalogue.vercel.app)

## Motivation

Since NextJS released a new version called AppRouter i want to explore more deep about that new technology, such as **Suspense**, **Server Components**, **Partial Rendering**, and much more.

## Challenge

Challenge on this project is i need to learn slowly about server components, it's tricky i need to learn composition between **client components** and **server components**. New **AppRouter** somehow is slow in my device macbook pro 2017 compared to **Pages Router**. This problem maybe can be encountered by using turbopack which i haven't try it.

This is also my first time using **Cheerio** library to scrapping since i don't have the db. But its lightweight and easy to understand.

## Stack

In this project i use stack that i commonly used, such as:

-   NextJS 14 (App router)
-   NextUI for component library
-   TailwindCSS for styling
-   React-swiper slider
-   Cheerio for scrapping data from [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net)

## Features

All features that include in this project are:

-   Upcoming anime in next season
-   Anime ranking (Most popular, most favorite, top airing, top anime)
-   Anime search
-   Show anime by genre
-   Show specific anime information like rating, synopsis, characters and staffs
-   Show review from user

## Improvements

I know this projects is not perfect, its still slow and heavy because the speed is depend on website MyAnimeList.net which i have no control over. The lighthouse score to is so low its around 50-60. I will improve this later.
