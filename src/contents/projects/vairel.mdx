## Introduction

Vairel is a project I created to help users analyze and gain insights from other accounts. It can provide insights such as which content is most liked by the account, what type of content the account posts most frequently, and at what hours the account typically posts. This allows us to copy their strategy.

## Motivation

Analyzing Instagram accounts can be expensive and time-consuming, especially if we sort through thousands of posts manually. Creating content can also be frustrating. By analyzing competitor accounts and identifying their most liked content, we can create similar content with the same hashtags and posting times.

## Challenges

This is my first experience building a browser extension, so I had to learn how web browsers communicate with extensions. It is different from building web applications.

## Stack

In this project, I use the following stack:

-   React + Vite + Typescript
-   Next-UI
-   @crxjs vite plugin

## Features

All features that include in this project are:

-   Analyze competitor instagram posts
    <Image
        blurSrc="/assets/projects/vairel-posts.gif"
        src="/assets/projects/vairel-posts.gif"
        alt="posts"
    />
-   Analyze competitor insights
    <Image
        blurSrc="/assets/projects/vairel-insights.gif"
        src="/assets/projects/vairel-insights.gif"
        alt="posts"
    />
-   Advance search
    <Image
        blurSrc="/assets/projects/vairel-search.gif"
        src="/assets/projects/vairel-search.gif"
        alt="posts"
    />
-   Download content

## Improvements

I plan to add more features, such as switching between multiple accounts.
