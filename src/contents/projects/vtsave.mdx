## Introduction

[vtsave.com](https://vtsave.com) is a project I created to help people easily download TikTok videos without watermarks. Motivated by this goal, I continued to develop downloader tools for other platforms such as Instagram, Twitter/X, and Facebook.

## Motivation

There are many downloader tools available, but most websites focus on only one platform. I wanted to create an all-in-one downloader tools website, so users don't need to switch to another site when they want to download content from different platforms. Some websites are slow and heavy to access, but my website, built with Next.js, generates plain HTML to make it faster.

## Challenge

I use Cheerio to scrape downloaded data from various platforms. The HTML content differs significantly between them, so I need to handle each one carefully. Additionally, this website supports multiple languages, requiring word-by-word translation for each language (currently, it supports 23 languages).

## Stack

The features included in this project are:

-   NextJS 14 (Pages router) -> still can't move on from pages router👐
-   Chakra-ui for component library
-   Cheerio for scrapping data

## Features

All features that include in this project are:

-   Tiktok downloader without watermark and HD
-   Instagram downloader without watermark and HD
-   Facebook downloader without watermark and HD
-   Twitter/x downloader without watermark and HD
-   Support multiple languages

## Improvements

I plan to add more platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, and more. These will be coming soon ✨
